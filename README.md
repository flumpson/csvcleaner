# csvcleaner
Requirements:
Install Pip if you do not already have it installed.

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/\n

Then run 
```pip install -r requirements```

From there, look to run.py for configuring your own files

I recommend using csvlint for validating that your csv files are ready for ingest
